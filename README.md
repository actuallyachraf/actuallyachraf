### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**actuallyachraf/actuallyachraf** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

I am Achraf, I graduated with a BSc in Applied Mathematics (worked on the applications of [Differential Forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form) in [Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations)) currently on a Dipl.Eng (BSc and MSc included) in Software Engineering.
I am interested in Machine Learning,and Applied Mathematics (mostly Probability âˆ© Game Theory).

I am currently building tooling and machine learning models [@saferwall](https://saferwall.com).

Previously I built Machine Learning models to compete in [numer.ai](https://numer.ai/) and implemented [academically cited](https://sancy.iut-clermont.uca.fr/~lafourcade/PAPERS/PDF/technical-report-CGLY.pdf) cryptography libraries.

Some of the projects I worked on in the past :

- [A Test Driven Tutorial for zkSTARKs](https://github.com/actuallyachraf/zkstarks)
- [A Golang library for Homomorphic Encryption](https://github.com/actuallyachraf/gomorph)
- [Algebraic Primitives for Cryptography](https://github.com/actuallyachraf/algebra)
- You can find my study notes [here](https://github.com/actuallyachraf/study-notes)

I played with :

- [Theorem Proving with Lean](https://github.com/actuallyachraf/glowing-lean)
- [Algorithmic Game Theory](https://github.com/actuallyachraf/ag)

Who am I :

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about models, cryptography, mathematics but also spy thrillers and books.
