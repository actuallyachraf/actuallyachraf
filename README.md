### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**actuallyachraf/actuallyachraf** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

I am Achraf, I graduated with a BSc in Applied Mathematics (worked on the applications of [Differential Forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form) in [Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations)) currently on a Dipl.Eng (BSc and MSc included) in Software Engineering.

Currently I am building tooling and machine learning models [@saferwall](https://saferwall.com).

Previously I built Machine Learning models to compete in [numer.ai](https://numer.ai/) and implemented [cited](https://sancy.iut-clermont.uca.fr/~lafourcade/PAPERS/PDF/technical-report-CGLY.pdf) cryptography libraries.

Some of the projects I worked on in the past :

- [A Test Driven Implementation of zkSTARKs](https://github.com/actuallyachraf/zkstarks)
- [A Golang library for Homomorphic Encryption](https://github.com/actuallyachraf/gomorph)
- [A Javascript like programming language with an interpreter and VM](https://github.com/actuallyachraf/monkey-giggle)
- [A Golang library for Probabilistic Data Structures](https://github.com/actuallyachraf/sketch)
- [Algebraic Primitives for Cryptography](https://github.com/actuallyachraf/algebra)
- [Algorithmic Game Theory](https://github.com/actuallyachraf/ag)
- [An RFC6962 compatible implementation of merkle trees](https://github.com/actuallyachraf/go-merkle)
