### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**actuallyachraf/actuallyachraf** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

I am Achraf, I graduated with BSc in Applied Mathematics currently on a Dipl.Eng (BSc and MSc included in Software Engineering) 
my interests revolve around Decentralized Systems, Cryptography, Mathematics and Games. I currently work on implementing zkSNARKs and zkSTARKs in Blockchains
and study Theorem Proving and Algorithmic Game Theory.

Previously I built Machine Learning models to compete in [numer.ai](https://numer.ai/) and classify malware at [saferwall](https://saferwall.com).

Some of the projects I worked on recently :

- [A Test Driven Tutorial for zkSTARKs](https://github.com/actuallyachraf/zkstarks)
- [A Golang library for Homomorphic Encryption](https://github.com/actuallyachraf/gomorph)
- [Algebraic Primitives for Cryptography](https://github.com/actuallyachraf/algebra)
- You can find my study notes [here](https://github.com/actuallyachraf/study-notes)

Iâ€™m currently learning :

- [Theorem Proving with Lean](https://github.com/actuallyachraf/glowing-lean)
- [Algorithmic Game Theory](https://github.com/actuallyachraf/ag)

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that we're both interested in.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with building an artificial intelligence capable of proving convex optimization .
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about blockchains, cryptography, mathematics.
